  "body": "P#\r\n====================\r\nA language and toolkit for **building**, **analyzing**, **systematically testing** and **debugging** asynchronous reactive software, such as web-services and distributed systems.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\nThe P# framework provides:\r\n- Language extensions to C# for building **event-driven asynchronous** applications, writing **test harnesses**, and specifying **safety** and **liveness properties**.\r\n- A **systematic testing engine** that can capture and control all specified nondeterminism in the system, systematically explore the actual executable code to discover bugs, and report bug traces. A P# bug trace provides a global order of all communication events, and thus is easier to debug.\r\n- Support for **replaying** bug traces, and **debugging** them using the Visual Studio debugger.\r\n\r\nAlthough P# primarily targets .NET, it has also experimental support for systematically testing native C++ code.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\nThe best way to build and start using P# is to read our [wiki](https://github.com/p-org/PSharp/wiki).\r\n\r\nYou can also read the manual and available publications:\r\n\r\n- [Manual](https://github.com/p-org/PSharp/blob/master/Docs/Manual/manual.pdf)  \r\n- [Publications](https://github.com/p-org/PSharp/wiki/Publications)\r\n\r\n## How to contribute\r\n\r\nWe welcome contributions! However, before you start contributing, please read carefully the [development guidelines](https://github.com/p-org/PSharp/wiki/Contributing-Code).\r\n\r\n## Contact us\r\n\r\nIf you would like to use P# in your project, or have any specific questions, please feel free to contact one of the following members of the P# team (@p-org/psharp-developers):\r\n- Akash Lal (akashl@microsoft.com)\r\n- Rashmi Mudduluru (t-rasmud@microsoft.com)\r\n- Pantazis Deligiannis (pdeligia@microsoft.com)\r\n- Shaz Qadeer (qadeer@microsoft.com)\r\n- Cheng Huang (cheng.huang@microsoft.com)\r\n",
